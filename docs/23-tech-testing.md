# Pytest Guide for DCApiX

## Introduction

DCApiX uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.3.x/) as its testing framework, providing a robust foundation for unit, integration, and functional testing. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how pytest is used within DCApiX, serving as a central reference for developers who want to contribute tests or understand the testing architecture.

## Core Pytest Features in DCApiX

### Test Organization

DCApiX follows these principles for organizing tests:

- **Separate Test Types**: Unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests are clearly separated
- **Directory Structure**: Tests mirror the package structure they're testing
- **Naming Conventions**: Test files are named with `test_` prefix and test functions with `test_` prefix
- **Test Categories**: Tests are categorized using pytest markers like `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, etc.

The test directories are organized as follows:

```asciidoc
tests/
├── unit/            # Tests for individual components
├── integration/     # Tests for component interactions
├── functional/      # Tests for complete workflows
├── performance/     # Performance and benchmarking tests
├── security/        # Security and authorization tests
├── conftest.py      # Shared fixtures and configuration
├── factories.py     # Test data factories
└── utils.py         # Test utility functions
```

### AAA Pattern

DCApiX tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:

```python
def test_example():
    # Arrange - set up test data and conditions
    user = User(name="Test User", email="test@example.com")
    
    # Act - perform the action being tested
    result = user.validate()
    
    # Assert - verify the results
    assert result is True
    assert user.is_valid is True
```

This pattern makes tests more readable and maintainable by clearly separating the three phases of testing.

### Fixtures

DCApiX leverages pytest fixtures extensively for test setup and teardown. Fixtures are defined in `conftest.py` and in individual test modules as needed.

Example fixture usage:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_client():
    """Create a mock API client for testing."""
    client = ApiClient(
        base_url="https://api.example.com",
        auth_provider=MockAuthProvider(),
    )
    return client

def test_client_operation(mock_client):
    # The mock_client fixture is automatically injected
    response = mock_client.get("users")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

### Parameterized Tests

For testing multiple variations of the same scenario, DCApiX uses pytest's parameterization:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "input_value,expected_result",
    [
        (1, 1),
        (2, 4),
        (3, 9),
        (4, 16),
    ],
)
def test_square_function(input_value, expected_result):
    result = square(input_value)
    assert result == expected_result
```

### Mocking

DCApiX uses pytest-mock for creating mock objects and patching functions:

```python
def test_api_call(mocker):
    # Mock an external API call
    mock_response = {"data": [{"id": 1, "name": "Test User"}]}
    mock_get = mocker.patch("requests.get", return_value=mock_response)
    
    # Call the function that uses the external API
    result = get_users()
    
    # Verify the mock was called correctly
    mock_get.assert_called_once_with("https://api.example.com/users")
    assert result == mock_response["data"]
```

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
class TestUserModel:
    def test_user_creation(self):
        user = User(name="Test User", email="test@example.com")
        assert user.name == "Test User"
        assert user.email == "test@example.com"
    
    def test_user_validation(self):
        user = User(name="Test User", email="invalid_email")
        with pytest.raises(ValueError):
            user.validate()
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly:

```python
@pytest.mark.integration
class TestApiClientIntegration:
    def test_client_auth_provider_interaction(self, mock_auth_provider):
        client = ApiClient(base_url="https://api.example.com", auth_provider=mock_auth_provider)
        client.get("users")
        
        # Verify that the auth provider was used correctly
        assert mock_auth_provider.authenticate.called
```

### Functional Tests

Functional tests validate complete workflows and end-to-end scenarios:

```python
@pytest.mark.functional
class TestUserWorkflow:
    def test_create_update_delete_user(self, api_client):
        # Create a user
        user_data = {"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
        user = api_client.create_user(user_data)
        
        # Update the user
        updated_data = {"name": "Jane Doe"}
        updated_user = api_client.update_user(user["id"], updated_data)
        
        # Verify update worked
        assert updated_user["name"] == "Jane Doe"
        assert updated_user["email"] == "john@example.com"
        
        # Delete the user
        result = api_client.delete_user(user["id"])
        assert result["success"] is True
        
        # Verify user no longer exists
        with pytest.raises(Exception):
            api_client.get_user(user["id"])
```

### Performance Tests

Performance tests measure execution time and resource usage:

```python
@pytest.mark.performance
def test_data_processing_performance(benchmark):
    # Generate test data
    data = [{"id": i, "value": i * 10} for i in range(1000)]
    
    # Benchmark the function
    result = benchmark(process_data, data)
    
    # Verify results
    assert len(result) == 1000
    assert result[0]["processed"] is True
```

### Security Tests

Security tests validate authentication, authorization, and data protection:

```python
@pytest.mark.security
class TestAuthentication:
    def test_password_hashing(self):
        password = "SecureP@ssw0rd"
        hashed_password = hash_password(password)
        
        # Ensure password is not stored in plaintext
        assert hashed_password != password
        
        # Verify password validation works
        assert verify_password(hashed_password, password) is True
        assert verify_password(hashed_password, "WrongPassword") is False
```

## Advanced Pytest Features

### Fixture Factories

DCApiX uses fixture factories to create customizable fixtures:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def create_user():
    """Factory fixture to create users with custom attributes."""
    def _create_user(**kwargs):
        default_data = {
            "name": "Test User",
            "email": "test@example.com",
            "role": "user",
        }
        default_data.update(kwargs)
        return User(**default_data)
    return _create_user

def test_admin_user(create_user):
    # Create a custom user using the factory fixture
    admin = create_user(role="admin")
    assert admin.role == "admin"
    assert admin.has_permission("manage_users") is True
```

### Fixture Scopes

DCApiX uses different fixture scopes to optimize test performance:

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def db_connection():
    """Create a database connection for the entire test session."""
    connection = create_connection()
    yield connection
    connection.close()

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def db_transaction(db_connection):
    """Create a transaction for each test function."""
    transaction = db_connection.begin()
    yield transaction
    transaction.rollback()
```

### Async Testing

DCApiX uses pytest-asyncio for testing asynchronous code:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_api_call():
    client = AsyncApiClient()
    result = await client.get_data()
    assert result["status"] == "success"
```

### Parametrized Fixtures

DCApiX uses parametrized fixtures for more flexible test scenarios:

```python
@pytest.fixture(params=["admin", "editor", "viewer"])
def user_role(request):
    """Fixture that provides different user roles."""
    return request.param

def test_role_permissions(user_role):
    user = User(role=user_role)
    if user_role == "admin":
        assert user.has_permission("manage_users") is True
    elif user_role == "editor":
        assert user.has_permission("edit_content") is True
        assert user.has_permission("manage_users") is False
    elif user_role == "viewer":
        assert user.has_permission("view_content") is True
        assert user.has_permission("edit_content") is False
```

### Test Markers

DCApiX uses pytest markers to categorize tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
@pytest.mark.security
def test_password_validation():
    # This test is both a unit test and a security test
    password = "SecureP@ssw0rd"
    assert is_password_strong(password) is True
```

Markers can be used to select or exclude specific tests:

```bash
# Run only unit tests
pytest -m "unit"

# Run all tests except integration tests
pytest -m "not integration"

# Run all security-related unit tests
pytest -m "unit and security"
```

## Testing Patterns and Best Practices

### Factory Pattern

DCApiX uses the factory pattern for creating test data with sensible defaults:

```python
# In tests/factories.py
class UserFactory:
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, overrides=None):
        """Create a user with defaults that can be overridden."""
        default_data = {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Test User",
            "email": "test@example.com",
            "role": "user",
            "active": True,
        }
        if overrides:
            default_data.update(overrides)
        
        # Create and return a User instance
        return User(**default_data)

# In tests
def test_user_permissions():
    admin = UserFactory.create({"role": "admin"})
    editor = UserFactory.create({"role": "editor"})
    
    assert admin.has_permission("manage_users") is True
    assert editor.has_permission("manage_users") is False
```

### Context Managers

DCApiX uses context managers to handle temporary resources and state changes:

```python
@contextmanager
def temp_env_vars(**kwargs):
    """Temporarily set environment variables for a test."""
    original_values = {}
    
    # Save original values and set temporary ones
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        if key in os.environ:
            original_values[key] = os.environ[key]
        os.environ[key] = str(value)
    
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        # Restore original values
        for key in kwargs:
            if key in original_values:
                os.environ[key] = original_values[key]
            else:
                del os.environ[key]

def test_configuration_from_env():
    with temp_env_vars(API_URL="https://api.example.com", API_KEY="test-key"):
        config = Config()
        assert config.api_url == "https://api.example.com"
        assert config.api_key == "test-key"
```

### Test Doubles

DCApiX uses various types of test doubles:

1. **Stubs**: Provide predefined responses to method calls
2. **Mocks**: Record method calls and verify expectations
3. **Fakes**: Simplified implementations of complex dependencies
4. **Spies**: Record method calls without altering behavior

Example using a spy:

```python
def test_client_retry_behavior(mocker):
    # Create a spy for the request function
    api_request = mocker.spy(ApiClient, "request")
    
    # Create a client with responses that will cause retries
    client = create_client_with_retryable_errors()
    
    # Make a request that will retry
    response = client.get("users")
    
    # Verify the request was retried the expected number of times
    assert api_request.call_count == 3  # Initial attempt + 2 retries
```

### Property-Based Testing

DCApiX uses hypothesis for property-based testing:

```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

@given(st.integers(), st.integers())
def test_addition_commutative(a, b):
    """Test that addition is commutative."""
    assert add(a, b) == add(b, a)

@given(st.lists(st.integers()))
def test_sort_idempotent(values):
    """Test that sorting is idempotent (sorting a sorted list changes nothing)."""
    once = sorted(values)
    twice = sorted(once)
    assert once == twice
```

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

DCApiX encourages test-driven development using the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write the simplest code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

## Testing Strategies

### Testing Pyramid

DCApiX follows the testing pyramid approach:

- **Unit Tests**: Many fast, focused tests that verify individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Moderate number of tests that verify component interactions
- **Functional Tests**: Fewer end-to-end tests that verify complete workflows

### Test Coverage

DCApiX uses pytest-cov to measure test coverage. The goal is to maintain high coverage while focusing on critical paths:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-report=html
```

Coverage reports are generated for each test run and examined as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### Visual Testing

For visual regression testing, DCApiX uses pytest-html to generate visual reports:

```bash
# Generate HTML report
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

### Parallel Testing

For faster test execution, DCApiX uses pytest-xdist to run tests in parallel:

```bash
# Run tests in parallel using 4 processes
pytest -n 4
```

### Performance Profiling

DCApiX uses pytest-profiling to identify performance bottlenecks:

```bash
# Run tests with profiling
pytest --profile
```

## CI/CD Integration

DCApiX integrates testing into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Pull Request Checks**: Run unit tests and linting for each PR
2. **Merge Checks**: Run integration and functional tests before merging
3. **Deployment Checks**: Run smoke tests after deployment
4. **Scheduled Tests**: Run comprehensive test suite on a schedule

## Troubleshooting Tests

Common issues and solutions:

### Test Order Dependencies

Issue: Tests depend on the order in which they run.
Solution: Ensure each test is independent and uses fixtures for setup and teardown.

### Slow Tests

Issue: Tests take too long to run.
Solution: Use mocks for external services, optimize fixture scopes, and run tests in parallel.

### Flaky Tests

Issue: Tests sometimes pass and sometimes fail.
Solution: Identify and eliminate sources of non-determinism such as race conditions, random values, or external dependencies.

## Example Test Patterns

### Testing HTTP APIs

```python
def test_api_response(requests_mock):
    # Mock the API response
    requests_mock.get(
        "https://api.example.com/users",
        json={"data": [{"id": 1, "name": "Test User"}]},
    )
    
    # Call the function that uses the API
    client = ApiClient(base_url="https://api.example.com")
    users = client.get_users()
    
    # Verify the response was processed correctly
    assert len(users) == 1
    assert users[0]["id"] == 1
    assert users[0]["name"] == "Test User"
```

### Testing Database Operations

```python
def test_database_operations(db_transaction):
    # Create a user in the database
    user_id = create_user_in_db("Test User", "test@example.com")
    
    # Verify the user was created
    user = get_user_by_id(user_id)
    assert user.name == "Test User"
    assert user.email == "test@example.com"
    
    # Update the user
    update_user(user_id, {"name": "Updated User"})
    
    # Verify the update worked
    updated_user = get_user_by_id(user_id)
    assert updated_user.name == "Updated User"
    assert updated_user.email == "test@example.com"
    
    # Transaction will be rolled back automatically by the fixture
```

### Testing File Operations

```python
def test_file_operations(temp_dir):
    # Create a file in the temporary directory
    file_path = temp_dir / "test.txt"
    with open(file_path, "w") as f:
        f.write("Test content")
    
    # Call the function that reads the file
    content = read_file(file_path)
    
    # Verify the content was read correctly
    assert content == "Test content"
    
    # The temporary directory will be deleted automatically by the fixture
```
