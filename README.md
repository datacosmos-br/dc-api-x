# dc-api-x ¬∑ Data Client API with Extensions üöÄ
>
> **The Datacosmos integration ecosystem** ‚Äì one import, one client, one CLI, every protocol.

DCApiX is a comprehensive Python integration ecosystem that combines a powerful framework, an extensible CLI tool, and a rich plugin architecture. It transforms how developers interact with multiple data sources, APIs, and protocols by providing a unified platform for all integration needs.

## Beyond Just a Framework

DCApiX delivers three complementary components that work together:

1. **Core Framework**: A unified client interface that abstracts away implementation details of diverse protocols
2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A rich terminal tool for direct interaction with any connected system
3. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extensible adapters for new protocols and systems without modifying core code

This holistic approach means you can use DCApiX as a programmatic library in your applications, as a CLI tool for direct operations and testing, or as a foundation to build custom integration plugins‚Äîall with the same consistent patterns and high-quality standards.

## What DCApiX Solves

Modern data applications often need to connect to diverse systems - REST APIs, databases, LDAP directories, message queues, and cloud services. Without DCApiX, this typically means:

* Learning multiple client libraries with different patterns and conventions
* Writing boilerplate code for authentication, error handling, and data transformation
* Managing inconsistent response formats and pagination mechanisms
* Implementing type safety and validation manually for each integration
* Dealing with observability and security in a fragmented way
* Building custom CLI tools for each integration point
* Creating proprietary plugin systems for extensibility

DCApiX solves these challenges by providing a unified, type-safe, and extensible platform across all these protocols, with enterprise-grade features built in.

from dc_api_x.config import Config
config = Config()  # Reads API_URL, API_USERNAME, etc.

# Load from a specific profile
dev_config = Config.from_profile("dev")  # Uses .env.dev file

# Save configuration to a file
config.save("config.json")

# Load from a file
config = Config.from_file("config.json")
```

Key features:

* Environment variables with custom prefixes
* Multiple configuration profiles for different environments
* Secure handling of sensitive information with SecretStr
* Save/load configurations to/from files
* Validation and conversion of configuration values

## üîç Type Management with MonkeyType

dc-api-x integrates MonkeyType for runtime type discovery and application. This helps maintain high-quality type annotations throughout the codebase.

### What is MonkeyType?

MonkeyType is a tool that collects runtime types during test execution and helps apply them to your Python code. It's particularly useful for:

* Discovering types in legacy code
* Verifying and improving existing type annotations
* Helping with the transition to typed Python

### Using MonkeyType via Makefile

```bash
# Run tests with MonkeyType enabled to collect runtime types
make monkeytype-run

# List modules with collected type information
make monkeytype-list

# Apply collected types to a specific module
make monkeytype-apply MODULE=dc_api_x.config

# Apply collected types to all modules with available type information
make monkeytype-apply-all

# Generate a type stub (.pyi file) for a specific module
make monkeytype-stub MODULE=dc_api_x.utils.logging
```

### Benefits of Type Annotations

* Enhanced code documentation
* Better IDE support with accurate auto-completion
* Early error detection via static type checking
* Improved code maintainability

Type annotations, combined with mypy static type checking, help catch issues before runtime and improve the overall code quality.

For more details, see the [26 - Tech: MonkeyType](docs/26-tech-monkeytype.md) guide for comprehensive MonkeyType integration documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Quality Tools

dc-api-x maintains high code quality through a comprehensive set of tools:

| Tool | Purpose | Command |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Black** | Code formatting | `make format` |
| **isort** | Import sorting | `make format` |
| **Ruff** | Fast linting | `make lint` |
| **Mypy** | Static type checking | `make lint` |
| **Bandit** | Security scanning | `make security` |
| **Pre-commit** | Git hooks | `pre-commit run --all-files` |
| **auto_lint_fix.sh** | Automated fixing | `./scripts/auto_lint_fix.sh` |

### Automated Code Quality Workflow

For efficient development, we recommend using our automated lint-fix cycle:

```bash
# Run from project root
./scripts/auto_lint_fix.sh
```

This script:

1. Runs `make lint` to check for issues
2. If issues are found, runs `make lint-fix` and `make format`
3. Repeats the process until no issues are found or max attempts reached
4. Provides detailed output on progress and remaining issues

Options:

* `DEBUG=1 ./scripts/auto_lint_fix.sh` - Show detailed debugging output
* `MAX_CYCLES=5 ./scripts/auto_lint_fix.sh` - Set maximum number of cycles

Our linting tools help catch issues early:

* **Magic values**: Use constants instead of literals (HTTP_OK = 200)
* **Unused arguments**: Prefix with underscore (_unused_arg)
* **Complex expressions**: Break down complex logic into smaller functions
* **Missing type hints**: All public APIs are fully typed

See [10 - Development: Code Quality](docs/10-development-code-quality.md) for best practices.

# Type System Updates

The type system has been modernized to use Python 3.10+ type annotation features:

* Replaced `Optional[X]` with `X | None` syntax (PEP 604)
* Replaced `Union[A, B]` with `A | B` union operator
* Added central `type_definitions.py` for common type definitions
* Updated Protocol classes for better structural typing
* Improved handling of circular imports with `TYPE_CHECKING`
* Enhanced TypeVar and Generic usage

See the updated documentation in [docs/25-tech-typing.md](docs/25-tech-typing.md) for details on the type system.

## Type Definitions

Common types are now defined in a central location:

```python
# Common JSON-related types
JsonValue = str | int | float | bool | None | list["JsonValue"] | dict[str, "JsonValue"]
JsonObject = dict[str, JsonValue]
JsonArray = list[JsonValue]

# HTTP related types
Headers = dict[str, str]
HttpMethod = str  # GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
StatusCode = int

# Entity related types
EntityId = str | int  # Common ID types
```
