# This is a CODEOWNERS file to define individuals or teams responsible for code in this repository
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# these users will be requested for review when someone 
# opens a pull request.
